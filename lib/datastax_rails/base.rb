module DatastaxRails #:nodoc:
  # = DatastaxRails
  #
  # DatastaxRails-based objects differ from Active Record objects in that they specify their
  # attributes directly on the model.  This is necessary because of the fact that Cassandra
  # column families do not have a set list of columns but rather can have different columns per
  # row.  By specifying the attributes on the model, getters and setters are automatically
  # created, and the attribute is automatically indexed into SOLR.
  #
  #
  # == Primary Keys
  #
  # Several types of primary keys are supported in DSR. The most common type used is UUID.
  # In general, incrementing numbers are not used as there is no way to guarantee a
  # consistent one-up number across nodes. The following will cause a unique UUID to be
  # generated for each model. This works best if you are using the RandomPartitioner in
  # your Datastax cluster.
  #
  #   class Person < DatastaxRails::Base
  #     key :uuid
  #   end
  #
  # If you want to use a natural key (i.e., one or more of the columns of your data),
  # the following would work.
  #
  #   class Person < DatastaxRails::Base
  #     key :natural, :attributes => [:last_name, :first_name]
  #   end
  #
  # Finally, you can create a custom key based on a method on your model.
  #
  #   class Person < DatastaxRails::Base
  #     key :custom, :method => :my_key
  #     
  #     def my_key
  #       # Some logic to generate a key
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # == Attributes
  #
  # Attributes are specified near the top of the model. The following attribute types
  # are supported:
  #
  # * array - an array of strings
  # * binary - a large object that will not be indexed into SOLR (e.g., BLOB)
  # * boolean - true/false values
  # * date - a date without a time component
  # * float - a number in floating point notation
  # * integer - a whole, round number of any size
  # * string - a generic string type that is not tokenized by default
  # * text - like strings but will be tokenized for full-text searching by default
  # * time - a datetime object
  # * timestamps - a special type that instructs DSR to include created_at and updated_at
  #
  # The following options may be specified on the various types to control how they
  # are indexed into SOLR:
  #
  # * indexed - If the attribute should the attribute be indexed into SOLR.
  #   Defaults to true for everything but binary.
  # * stored - If the attribute should the attribute be stored in SOLR.
  #   Defaults to true for everything but binary. (see note)
  # * sortable - If the attribute should be sortable by SOLR.
  #   Defaults to true for everything but binary and text. (see note)
  # * tokenized - If the attribute should be tokenized for full-text searching within the field.
  #   Defaults to true for array and text. (see note)
  # * fulltext - If the attribute should be included in the default field for full-text searches.
  #   Defaults to true for text and string.
  #
  # NOTES:
  # * No fields are actually stored in SOLR. When a field is requested from SOLR, the field
  #   is retrieved from Cassandra behind the scenes and returned as if it were stored. The
  #   stored parameter actually controls whether SOLR will return the field at all. If a field
  #   is not stored then asking SOLR for it will return a nil value. It will also not be
  #   included in the field list when all (*) fields are requested.
  # * If you want a field both sortable and searchable (e.g., a subject) then declare it a
  #   text field with <tt>:sortable => true</tt>. This will create two copies of the field in SOLR,
  #   one that gets tokenized and one that is a single token for sorting. As this inflates the
  #   size of the index, you don't want to do this for large fields (which probably don't make
  #   sense to sort on anyways).
  # * Arrays are tokenized specially. Each element of the array is treated as a single token.
  #   This means that you can match against any single element, but you cannot search within
  #   elements. This functionality may be added at a later time.
  #
  # EXAMPLE:
  # 
  #   class Person < DatastaxRails::Base
  #     key     :uuid
  #     string  :first_name
  #     string  :user_name
  #     text    :bio
  #     date    :birthdate
  #     boolean :active
  #     timestamps
  #   end
  #
  # == Schemas
  #
  # Cassandra itself is a 'schema-optional' database.  In general, DSR does not make use of
  # Cassandra schemas.  SOLR on the other hand does use a schema to define the data and how
  # it should be indexed.  There is a rake task to upload the latest SOLR schema based on
  # the model files.  When this happens, if the column family does not exist yet, it will be
  # created.  Therefore, migrations to create column families are unnecessary.  If the
  # column family does exist, and the new schema differs, the columns that are changed will
  # be automatically reindexed.
  #
  # TODO: Need a way to remove ununsed column families.
  #
  # == Creation
  #
  # DatastaxRails objects accept constructor parameters either in a hash or as a block. The hash
  # method is especially useful when you're receiving the data from somewhere else, like an
  # HTTP request. It works like this:
  #
  #   user = User.new(:name => "David", :occupation => "Code Artist")
  #   user.name # => "David"
  #
  # You can also use block initialization:
  #
  #   user = User.new do |u|
  #     u.name = "David"
  #     u.occupation = "Code Artist"
  #   end
  #
  # And of course you can just create a bare object and specify the attributes after the fact:
  #
  #   user = User.new
  #   user.name = "David"
  #   user.occupation = "Code Artist"
  #
  # == Consistency
  #
  # Cassandra has a concept of consistency levels when it comes to saving records.  For a
  # detailed discussion on Cassandra data consistency, see:
  # http://www.datastax.com/docs/1.0/dml/data_consistency
  #
  # DatastaxRails allows you to specify the consistency when you save and retrieve objects.
  #
  #   user = User.new(:name => 'David')
  #   user.save(:consistency => 'ALL')
  #
  #   User.create(params[:user], {:consistency => :local_quorum})
  #
  #   User.consistency(:local_quorum).where(:name => 'David')
  #
  # The default consistency level in DatastaxRails is QUORUM for writes and for retrieval
  # by ID.  SOLR only supports a consistency level of ONE.  See the documentation for
  # SearchMethods#consistency for a more detailed explanation.
  #
  # The overall default consistency for a given model can be overridden by setting the
  # +default_consistency+ property.
  #
  #   class Model < DatastaxRails::Base
  #     self.default_consistency = :local_quorum
  #   end
  #
  # The default consistency for all models can be selected by setting the property on
  # DatastaxRails::Base.
  #
  #   DatastaxRails::Base.default_consistency = :one
  #
  # == Conditions
  #
  # Conditions are specified as a hash representing key/value pairs that will eventually be passed to SOLR or as
  # a chained call for greater_than and less_than conditions.  In addition, fulltext queries may be specified as a
  # string that will eventually be parsed by SOLR as a standard SOLR query.
  #
  # A simple hash without a statement will generate conditions based on equality using boolean AND logic.
  # For instance:
  #
  #   Student.where(:first_name => "Harvey", :status => 1)
  #   Student.where(params[:student])
  #
  # A range may be used in the hash to use a SOLR range query:
  #
  #   Student.where(:grade => 9..12)
  #
  # An array may be used in the hash to construct a SOLR OR query:
  #
  #   Student.where(:grade => [9,11,12])
  #
  # Inequality can be tested for like so:
  #
  #   Student.where_not(:grade => 9)
  #   Student.where(:grade).greater_than(9)
  #   Student.where(:grade).less_than(10)
  #
  # Fulltext searching is natively supported.  All text fields are automatically indexed for fulltext
  # searching.
  #
  #   Post.fulltext('Apple AND "iPhone 4s"')
  #
  # See the documentation on DatastaxRails::SearchMethods for more information and examples.
  #
  # == Overwriting default accessors
  #
  # All column values are automatically available through basic accessors on the DatastaxRails,
  # but sometimes you want to specialize this behavior. This can be done by overwriting
  # the default accessors (using the same name as the attribute) and calling
  # <tt>read_attribute(attr_name)</tt> and <tt>write_attribute(attr_name, value)</tt> to actually
  # change things.
  #
  #   class Song < DatastaxRails::Base
  #     # Uses an integer of seconds to hold the length of the song
  #
  #     def length=(minutes)
  #       write_attribute(:length, minutes.to_i * 60)
  #     end
  #
  #     def length
  #       read_attribute(:length) / 60
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # You can alternatively use <tt>self[:attribute]=(value)</tt> and <tt>self[:attribute]</tt>
  # instead of <tt>write_attribute(:attribute, value)</tt> and <tt>read_attribute(:attribute)</tt>.
  #
  # == Dynamic attribute-based finders
  #
  # Note: These are only available in Rails 3.x applications, and are not supported in Rails 4.x
  #
  # Dynamic attribute-based finders are a cleaner way of getting (and/or creating) objects
  # by simple queries without using where chains. They work by appending the name of an attribute
  # to <tt>find_by_</tt> or <tt>find_all_by_</tt> and thus produces finders
  # like <tt>Person.find_by_user_name</tt>, <tt>Person.find_all_by_last_name</tt>, and
  # <tt>Payment.find_by_transaction_id</tt>. Instead of writing
  # <tt>Person.where(:user_name => user_name).first</tt>, you just do <tt>Person.find_by_user_name(user_name)</tt>.
  # And instead of writing <tt>Person.where(:last_name => last_name).all</tt>, you just do
  # <tt>Person.find_all_by_last_name(last_name)</tt>.
  #
  # It's also possible to use multiple attributes in the same find by separating them with "_and_".
  #
  #   Person.where(:user_name => user_name, :password => password).first
  #   Person.find_by_user_name_and_password(user_name, password) # with dynamic finder
  #
  # It's even possible to call these dynamic finder methods on relations and named scopes.
  #
  #   Payment.order("created_on").find_all_by_amount(50)
  #   Payment.pending.find_last_by_amount(100)
  #
  # The same dynamic finder style can be used to create the object if it doesn't already exist.
  # This dynamic finder is called with <tt>find_or_create_by_</tt> and will return the object if
  # it already exists and otherwise creates it, then returns it. Protected attributes won't be set
  # unless they are given in a block.
  #
  # NOTE: This functionality is currently unimplemented but will be in a release in the near future.
  #
  #   # No 'Summer' tag exists
  #   Tag.find_or_create_by_name("Summer") # equal to Tag.create(:name => "Summer")
  #
  #   # Now the 'Summer' tag does exist
  #   Tag.find_or_create_by_name("Summer") # equal to Tag.find_by_name("Summer")
  #
  #   # Now 'Bob' exist and is an 'admin'
  #   User.find_or_create_by_name('Bob', :age => 40) { |u| u.admin = true }
  #
  # Use the <tt>find_or_initialize_by_</tt> finder if you want to return a new record without
  # saving it first. Protected attributes won't be set unless they are given in a block.
  #
  #   # No 'Winter' tag exists
  #   winter = Tag.find_or_initialize_by_name("Winter")
  #   winter.persisted? # false
  #
  # Just like <tt>find_by_*</tt>, you can also use <tt>scoped_by_*</tt> to retrieve data. The good thing about
  # using this feature is that the very first time result is returned using <tt>method_missing</tt> technique
  # but after that the method is declared on the class. Henceforth <tt>method_missing</tt> will not be hit.
  #
  #   User.scoped_by_user_name('David')
  #
  # == Facets
  #
  # DSR support both field and range facets.  For additional detail on facets, see the documentation
  # available under the FacetMethods module.  The result is available through the facets accessor
  #
  # Facet examples:
  #
  # results = Article.field_facet(:author)
  # results.facets => {"author"=>["vonnegut", 2. "asimov", 3]} 
  #
  # Model.field_facet(:author)
  # Model.field_facet(:author, :sort => 'count', :limit => 10, :mincount => 1)
  # Model.range_facet(:price, 500, 1000, 10)
  # Model.range_facet(:price, 500, 1000, 10, :include => 'all')
  # Model.range_facet(:publication_date, "1968-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2000-01-01T00:00:00Z", "+1YEAR")
  #
  # Range Gap syntax for dates: +1YEAR, +5YEAR, +5YEARS, +1MONTH, +1DAY
  #
  # Useful constants:
  #
  # DatastaxRails::FacetMethods::BY_YEAR  (+1YEAR)
  # DatastaxRails::FacetMethods::BY_MONTH (+1MONTH)
  # DatastaxRails::FacetMethods::BY_DAY   (+1DAY)
  #
  # Model.range_facet(:publication_date, "1968-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2000-01-01T00:00:00Z", DatastaxRails::FacetMethods::BY_YEAR)
  #
  # == Exceptions
  #
  # * DatastaxRailsError - Generic error class and superclass of all other errors raised by DatastaxRails.
  # * AssociationTypeMismatch - The object assigned to the association wasn't of the type
  #   specified in the association definition.
  # * ConnectionNotEstablished+ - No connection has been established. Use <tt>establish_connection</tt>
  #   before querying.
  # * RecordNotFound - No record responded to the +find+ method. Either the row with the given ID doesn't exist
  #   or the row didn't meet the additional restrictions. Some +find+ calls do not raise this exception to signal
  #   nothing was found, please check its documentation for further details.
  # * MultiparameterAssignmentErrors - Collection of errors that occurred during a mass assignment using the
  #   <tt>attributes=</tt> method. The +errors+ property of this exception contains an array of
  #   AttributeAssignmentError objects that should be inspected to determine which attributes triggered the errors.
  # * AttributeAssignmentError - An error occurred while doing a mass assignment through the
  #   <tt>attributes=</tt> method.
  #   You can inspect the +attribute+ property of the exception object to determine which attribute
  #   triggered the error.
  #
